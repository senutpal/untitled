abstract: "Data is the center of many applications today. The challenges are no longer compute-bound but data-bound—complexity arises from the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing."
takeaways:

    title: "Reliability, Scalability, Maintainability"
    description: "The three pillars of any data system. Reliability means the system continues to work correctly even when things go wrong (hardware, software, human error). Scalability is the ability to handle increased load, often measured by percentiles (p95, p99) rather than averages."
  - icon: "database"
    title: "Data Models & Query Languages"
    description: "The comparison between Relational vs. Document models is nuanced. Relational models excel at many-to-many relationships, while Document models provide better locality for data that is typically accessed together."
  - icon: "git-branch"
    title: "Distributed Data Challenges"
    description: "Replication and Partitioning (Sharding) are the fundamental tools for scale. Understanding the trade-offs between Synchronous vs. Asynchronous replication is critical for handling node failures without losing consistency."
highlights:
  - quote: "Transitions from one data model to another are often slow and painful. But choosing the right model for the right task is one of the most important architectural decisions you can make."

  - quote: "If you are monitoring your system's performance, look at the tail latencies. The 99.9th percentile is what matters for the users who are actually paying your bills."
    source: "pg. 14 · chapter 1"
  - quote: "Distributed systems are hard because they involve partial failures. Unlike a single computer, a distributed system might have parts that are working and parts that are broken in ways that are difficult to detect."

This is essentially the "Bible" of modern backend engineering. Kleppmann manages to explain incredibly dense academic concepts (Consensus algorithms, B-Trees vs LSM-Trees, Linearizability) with practical industry context.

My biggest takeaway was shifting from thinking about "databases" as black boxes to thinking about "data systems" as a composition of smaller components (indexes, caches, message brokers).

- Read Chapter 3 twice if you care about storage engine performance.
- Chapter 7 is the best explanation of Transactions/ACID I've found.
- The "Unreliable Networks" chapter will make you paranoid (in a good way).
