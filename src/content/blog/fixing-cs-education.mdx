Why we need more systems programming and less framework fatigue. A critique of the modern curriculum and a proposal for a more "bottom-up" approach to learning computer science.

## the problem

Most CS programs today focus heavily on high-level abstractions. Students learn React before they understand how the DOM works. They use ORMs without knowing SQL. They deploy to "the cloud" without understanding what a process is.

## a better approach

Start from the metal and work up. Teach memory management before garbage collection. Teach TCP before HTTP. Teach assembly before Python.

This isn't about being elitist—it's about building genuine understanding that scales with complexity.
