A manifesto on slow software and digital permaculture. Thinking about software longevity, maintenance-first design, and building tools that last decades rather than weeks.

## the velocity trap

We've optimized for shipping speed at the expense of everything else. Move fast and break things became move fast and accumulate debt.

## digital permaculture

What if we designed software the way permaculture designs gardens? Systems that are self-sustaining, that improve with age, that work with their environment rather than against it.

The goal isn't to stop building—it's to build things worth maintaining.
